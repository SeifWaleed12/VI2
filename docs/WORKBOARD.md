# Workboard

Shared task list for every agent working in this repository (Claude, GPT).
Read this before starting. Claim a task by setting Owner and Status before
editing files. Do not work on a task another agent owns. Update the row when
you finish, and record anything left open in Notes.

Rules: see the root `AGENTS.md`. Shared files (`package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/decisions/`) need the owner's (Seif's)
approval before any change.

## How we work

Roles:
- **Seif (owner):** chooses the tasks, passes messages between the agents, makes
  the decisions listed below, and is the only one who merges.
- **Claude (author):** writes all the code, one task at a time, on branch
  `claude/work`.
- **GPT (reviewer):** reviews each finished task. GPT reports problems and does
  not edit the code.

Flow for every task:
1. Claude claims the task in "Open: ready to pick up" (Owner = Claude, Status =
   in progress).
2. Claude implements it on `claude/work`, following `AGENTS.md` (Medusa first,
   clean architecture, SOLID, thin routes, tests), and runs `npm run check`.
3. Claude commits, moves the task to "In review", and lists the commits and
   anything GPT should look at closely.
4. Seif tells GPT to review. GPT reads the changes between `full-stack` and
   `claude/work`, then writes `docs/reviews/<task-name>.md` with each problem,
   its file and line, and why it matters. GPT does not edit code.
5. Seif tells Claude to fix the review notes. Claude fixes them on the same
   branch and answers each note in the review file.
6. When GPT has no open problems and `npm run check` passes, Seif merges
   `claude/work` into `full-stack` and the task moves to "Done".

GPT review checklist (from `AGENTS.md`):
- Requirement met, and nothing beyond it (no Phase-2 work, no unrelated refactor).
- Uses a Medusa primitive instead of rebuilding one.
- Layers respected: routes thin, business rules in workflows/modules, provider
  code behind a contract, UI components contain no business rules.
- SOLID and clean code (section 4.1), without abstractions that have no real benefit.
- Security: input validated, authorization checked server-side, no client-trusted
  prices/totals/stock/payment success, no secrets exposed.
- Failure, timeout and idempotency handled where relevant.
- Tests added for the behavior and the negative cases; none deleted or weakened.
- Style: no semicolons, double quotes, 2 spaces, kebab-case files.

## Decided (by Seif)

| Decision | Date |
|---|---|
| MVP has exactly two roles: `admin` (full access) and `manager` (the Catalog Manager role). More roles are Phase 2. | 2026-10-06 |
| Login is email and password only. Phone OTP and OAuth 2 are Phase 2. | 2026-10-06 |
| Claude writes all code, GPT reviews. Revisit once the process runs smoothly. | 2026-10-06 |
| Code follows clean architecture and SOLID as written in `AGENTS.md` section 4.1. | 2026-10-06 |
| One review per task, never batched. Claude does not start the next task until the current one is merged or Seif says otherwise. | 2026-10-06 |
| Quick-variant merged with R3-1 and R3-2 accepted as known limitations; no further changes. | 2026-10-06 |

## In review

| Task | Author | Branch | Commits | Review file | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (none) | | | | | |

## Done

| Task | Owner | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Trustworthy checkout confirmation + regression tests | GPT, then Claude | cdfbea8, db8b2d8 | Success requires a Medusa `order_` ID; confirmation page reads the order from Medusa. Unknown outcomes keep the same cart for retry. |
| 2. Lint/type errors; `npm run check` covers both apps | GPT, then Claude | cdfbea8, e2af23c | 0 errors. 21 storefront lint warnings remain (`<img>`, setState-in-effect), all in code not otherwise touched. |
| 3. Remove invented availability/social proof; brand/region owners | GPT, then Claude | cdfbea8, 8497eca | Brand comes from the linked Brand module; region must be a real EGP/EG Medusa region; ratings shown only when reviews exist (none do). |
| 4. Validation, secrets, safe errors, admin authorization, timeouts | GPT, then Claude | cdfbea8, e2af23c, b42edaf | Catalog Manager now matches RD v1.1 section 2.2 (no pricing, stock, publishing). Staff invite acceptance unblocked. Guest buyers can register. |
| 5. AGENTS.md: clean architecture, SOLID, MVP decisions, multi-agent rules | Claude | fe48d5c | Approved by Seif. |
| 6. Quick-variant partial failure: option or value is rolled back if the variant fails | Claude, reviewed by GPT (3 rounds) | f403587, fead9e2, 149a95d | Review: `docs/reviews/quick-variant.md`. 10 PostgreSQL integration tests pass; `npm run check` green. Merged by Seif's decision with two known limitations recorded in the review file (R3-1 timing risk with a concurrent native admin write; R3-2 lock has no per-request owner and expires after 120 s). Production needs a shared lock provider (Redis) if more than one server runs. |

## Open: blocked, waiting on Seif

| Item | Why it is blocked |
|---|---|
| Admin dashboard usability for the manager role | Only catalog APIs are allowed. Dashboard pages also call stores, regions, sales channels, and so on. Needs a test with a real manager login by Seif. |
| Payment methods (Paymob), Bosta shipment ownership, Odoo sync contract | Seif is collecting more information. Do not build, stub or guess these until Seif releases the work. Production checkout stays disabled until then (`apps/backend/src/api/middlewares.ts`). |
| Brand visibility for the manager role | The manager can currently hide or show a whole brand; the requirements matrix does not mention brands. Seif to confirm whether this stays. |
| Guest account provisioning, expiry dates, analytics | RD asks for them; `docs/MVP-SCOPE.md` excludes or does not mention them. Seif to decide. |

## Open: ready to pick up

| Task | Owner | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP integration tests for auth, cart, checkout, admin access | — | open | Needs a test PostgreSQL. `npm run test:integration:http` in `apps/backend`. |
| Remaining storefront lint warnings | — | open | Low priority; style only. |
| Split oversized storefront components (for example `ProductDetailClient.tsx`, `CheckoutClient.tsx`) | — | open | Matches the clean code goal, but is a refactor. Needs Seif's approval before starting. |
